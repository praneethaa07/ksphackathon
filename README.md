Project Description:

This project, named "Copwatch (Placeholder Encryption and Face Recognition)", aims to enhance data security and access control through advanced techniques such as face recognition and two-factor authentication (2FA) using HMAC-based One-Time Password (HOTP) and Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP). Additionally, the project utilizes Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) algorithms for generating and managing placeholders, ensuring the privacy and integrity of sensitive data.

Key Features:

- *Face Recognition*: Utilizes facial recognition technology to authenticate users before granting access to sensitive data or functionalities.

- *Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)*: Implements both HMAC-based One-Time Password (HOTP) and Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) for additional layers of security.

- *Placeholder Encryption*: Employs Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) algorithms to generate and manage placeholders, ensuring data privacy and integrity.
- Copwatch for Data Privacy in law enforcement is our cutting-edge project that combines advanced face recognition technology with two-factor authentication and placeholder encryption using RNN algorithms for enhanced data security and access control. With features like HOTP and TOTP code scanning via QR code, it ensures robust protection and privacy of sensitive information.
- *Multi language support*: In our data privacy project, we leveraged the multi-language support feature to ensure seamless compliance across diverse linguistic user bases, facilitating comprehensive communication and understanding of privacy protocols globally. This feature enabled tailored privacy documentation and alerts in users' preferred languages, enhancing accessibility and adherence to privacy guidelines.
  
-Technologies Used:
- Python
- OpenCV (for face recognition)
- speakeasy (for generating HOTP and TOTP codes)
- TensorFlow (for RNN implementation)
